# Jog-Log

A simple run tracking app to replace Strava (for me), that I used for a long time, until I became more and more uneasy about putting the data of my natural body's movements in the hands of a somewhat faceless enterprise. Somewhat from genuine fear of not-knowing their intentions — and somewhat for the simple principle of it.

I wasn't worried about GPS tracking– I just wanted a way to keep track of how far I'd run each day, week, year, etc. and also how far I'd run in each shoe– so as when to replace them.

This is the front-end made, made from React, which I did to experiment with using React. It supports account creation, but you can simply load my data (in the top right menu) if you don't want to bother with that and just see what it looks like instead.
